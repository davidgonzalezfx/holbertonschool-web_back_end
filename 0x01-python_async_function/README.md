## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What you should learn from this project:

* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3
* Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5.x)
* All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
* All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
* All your functions should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
